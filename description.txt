Every evening set of friends goes to a bar and end of the drinks one friend will settle the bill for all. Another day another friend will pay the bill etc. After few days they will use this app (website) to split the amount they spent. They will input a json like follows.

amount = total bill for the day
paid_by = name of the user who paid the bill and this will be unique
friends = names of the friends who came to the bar on the given day (name will appear multiple times if a friend bring another friend of him who is not in this group )
